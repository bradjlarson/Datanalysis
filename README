Datanalysis project 

This project never really got finished. I got it to the point where it was functional but not polished at all, and only the core functin worked. 

The idea behind the project was to provide an interface to easily create and store SQL queries. Those SQL queries would be stored as SQL, along with a number of attributes that allowed me to represent that SQL in chart form. The chart's data is always up-to-date because the underlying object is a SQL query.
