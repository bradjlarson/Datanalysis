#This is the readme for my Datanalysis project.
#
#The project is designed to make it easier to do
#data driven analysis over time, as you can set a script,
#come back X hours/days/months later and see your results. 
#It also makes monitoring a breeze. Simply input your monitoring
#script, set your limits, and you're good to go.
